# data-structures
Implementations of data structures including (but not limited to!) queue, heap, and hash table. Each data structure includes a tester file which can be accessed by running the command "**make run**" on the command line. To use valgrind and check that there are no memory leaks, run "**make memcheck**".

Written in C++ for CS240: Data Structures and Algorithms at Binghamton University.
